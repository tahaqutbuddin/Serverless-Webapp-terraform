In this tutorial, I have created Terraform scripts for a simple serverless web application that enables users to request unicorn rides from the Wild Rydes fleet. The application will present users with an HTML-based user interface for indicating the location where they would like to be picked up and will interact with a RESTful web service on the backend to submit the request and dispatch a nearby unicorn. The application will also provide facilities for users to register with the service and log in before requesting ride.
